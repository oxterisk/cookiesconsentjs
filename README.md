# Cookies Consent JS

**Cookies Consent JS** is an easy-to-use javascript library to show the cookies consent message and manage the users consent according to the cookies law GDPR and ePrivacy Directive.

You can easily customize the design by changing the theme or creating a new one and it is ready to use with **Google Analytics** and **Google Tag Manager**.

# Basic usage

Place the stylesheet links into the head before all other stylesheets to load the CSS.

```

Place the script near the end of your pages, right before the closing body tag.

```HTML
<script src="cookiesconsent.min.js"></script>
```

Call the function after your scripts and set the parameters.

```HTML
<script> const cc = CookiesConsentJS({ parameters }); </script>
```

```HTML
<script src="modules/cc-ga.js"></script>
<script src="cookiesconsent.min.js"></script>
```

When using Google Tag Manager service it is necessary to call the **cc-gtm.js** module before the main library. [See example](https://www.oxterisk.com/projects/cookies-consent-js/ccjs-examples/ccjs-google-tag-manager-cookie/)

```HTML
<script src="modules/cc-gtm.js"></script>
<script src="cookiesconsent.min.js"></script>
